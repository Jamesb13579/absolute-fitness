![Colour Scheme](docs/readme_images/colour_scheme.png)

For this site i wanted to keep the colour scheme clean and simple. the colours mostly used were white red and black. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility.

#### Imagery
There is only one main static image on the site which is of a weigt room in a gym.

## Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/AliOKeeffe/projects/2)


The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Database Schema 

Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication

Where I have used Django's Class-based-views; Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

Where I have used function based views I have used Django's login_required decorators to restrict access as required. 

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error.

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. Stripe keys and wh secret are also stored in the env.py file. 

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:
Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

## Marketing Strategy

A number of different marketing strategies have been utilised to promote Absolute Fitness including SEO, social media marketing and email marketing. Each of these strategies have been discussed individually below:  

### SEO
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results:

**Keywords:** 

For the site, a combination of long tail and short tail keywords were carefully evaluated. In order to do keyword research, wordtracker.com was used, along with Google search results and competition keyword research.

The site's meta-keywords and meta-description now contain the most pertinent keywords. 

**Sitemap and robots.txt**

To make sure that search engines can comprehend the site's structure and simply navigate through the site, a sitemap uile was made with a list of important page URLs. This was created, utilizing xml-sitemaps.com.

To tell search engines which areas of the website they cannot access, a robots.txt file was built. By raising the site's quality, this raises SEO.


### Social Media Marketing 
For natural social media marketing, a Facebook business page has been made for this website. A "Shop Now" button on the Facebook page directs visitors to the Absolute Fitness website. The page works well with the content media marketing on the main site since it makes it simple to share pictures of previous projects and new product introductions.

![Facebook Page](docs/readme_images/facebook_page.png)

### Email Marketing
Visitors to the website can subscribe to the newsletter without creating an account. On the website, a signup form is present in the footer. This enables the company to inform clients and potential clients about new goods and services and promotional deals. This service was developed with Mailchimp.

    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
